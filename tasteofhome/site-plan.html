      <p>
        Welcome to Taste of Home! Whether you’re like me, and you’re just learning how to cook, or you want to improve your cooking skills, I hope we can learn together. My name is Taylor Porter, and I am leaving home for the first time as a freshman at BYU-Idaho. Living away from home has been exciting and challenging, and part of the challenge is knowing what to eat. I definitely miss my parents’ cooking, and want to learn how to make those same home-cooked meals (for myself and the ladies). It’s been intimidating having to plan meals, go grocery shopping, and cook things I’ve never cooked before, but it has also been an exciting challenge. Learning how to cook has been a fun process, and I’m excited to learn more. Let’s explore the world of cooking together!

      <h3>Cooking Chicken</h3>
      <h3>Defrosting</h3>
      <p>One thing I have learned is that you need to plan your meals ahead of time, so you can give frozen meat the time to defrost. When I took my chicken out of the freezer, it was rock solid, so separating it was a bit of a challenge. I ended up thawing it in the fridge for a couple hours so I could get the chicken I needed and put the rest back in the freezer. That was definitely not ideal, and my roommate suggested that I separate my chicken after I buy it. After getting the chicken I needed, I put it in a freezer bag and submerged it in cold water for an hour. It was still a bit hard in the middle after that, so I put it in the microwave to finish it.</p>

      <h3>Food Safety</h3>
      <p>Touching raw chicken for the first time was an experience. I wasn’t used to the weird, slimy texture, and I didn’t want it on my hands. It’s important to remember to wash your hands after touching raw meat, so you don’t spread bacteria. My roommate also taught me not to wash chicken because it spreads pathogens and bacteria everywhere. You also need to avoid cross-contamination by using separate dishware for raw meat and other foods and thoroughly washing anything that comes into contact with raw meat. Handling raw meat for the first time was scary, but I got through it with no food poisoning! If you take extra care to prepare your food safely, you should be good to go.</p>
      <h3>Cooking</h3>
      <p>Before I cooked the chicken, I cut it in half vertically to get a thinner cutlet that cooks through easier. I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic, getting that nice flavor. My roommate let me use his ninja grill, so I used a bit of coconut oil and slapped on the chicken. I let it sit until the bottom was golden brown, and flipped it over. I cooked it until I could easily cut through the chicken with a knife. If you have a food thermometer, use that to check the thickest part of the chicken. If it reads 165 or over, then you're good to go!
      </p>
      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p>Overall, I would say the chicken turned out pretty well! I was a bit worried about whether or not I overcooked or undercooked it, but luckily my roommate said it was thoroughly done. Because of that, the chicken was a bit tough, but the flavors went together well. I definitely learned how to cook this!

      <h3>Ramen</h3>
      <p>A nice bowl of ramen is a college classic, and can be a great comfort food if you're short on time or ingredients. I love this recipe from <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/spicy-peanut-butter-ramen/">Budget Bytes for spicy peanut butter ramen noodles</a>. I know. Peanut butter in ramen!? Trust me, it’s worth a try. The peanut butter helps create a delicious creamy sauce and adds a bit of sustenance and protein to the meal. I would recommend using a bit under ¼ cup in the sauce to have a creamer sauce. I also substituted chili garlic sauce with hot sauce with garlic powder and chili flakes for a while until I found the real deal at the grocery store. Personally, I like to add an egg and some frozen peas to the ramen while it’s cooking and top it with some sliced ham, but like the recipe says, feel free to add what you want!
      </p>
      <h3>Chicken Tikka Masala With Rice</h3>
      <p>Curry and rice has always been one of my go-to meals at home. Luckily, you can get curry sauce from the grocery store, making it super easy to make. If you have some canned chicken around, it’s even easier! Curry is one of my favorite ways to eat canned chicken and make it come to life. Simply put the chicken in a pan with a bit of oil, and add the curry sauce and let it simmer. Add some rice and vegetables, and you’ve got an effortless, delicious meal!
      </p>
      <h3>Barbeque chicken Quesadilla</h3>
      <p>I love myself a dang quesadilla! It’s definitely a life-saver when I’m in a crunch. Simply put a tortilla on a pan, add cheese, and boom! I always add a bit of extra cheese spilling out of the sides and on top of the quesadilla to get some nice, crispy cheese. It’s probably not good for cholesterol, but it’s good for my soul. I had some leftover grilled chicken one night, and I decided to chop it up and add it to my quesadilla with a spiral of barbeque sauce to give my quesadilla some extra protein and flavor.
