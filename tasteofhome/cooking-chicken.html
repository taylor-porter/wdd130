            <h2>Defrosting</h2>
            <p>One thing I have learned is that you need to plan your meals ahead of time, so you can give frozen meat the time to defrost. When I took my chicken out of the freezer, it was rock solid, so separating it was a bit of a challenge. I ended up thawing it in the fridge for a couple hours so I could get the chicken I needed and put the rest back in the freezer. That was definitely not ideal, and my roommate suggested that I separate my chicken after I buy it. After getting the chicken I needed, I put it in a freezer bag and submerged it in cold water for an hour. It was still a bit hard in the middle after that, so I put it in the microwave to finish it.</p>

            <h2>Food Safety</h2>
            <p>Touching raw chicken for the first time was an experience. I wasn’t used to the weird, slimy texture, and I didn’t want it on my hands. It’s important to remember to wash your hands after touching raw meat, so you don’t spread bacteria. My roommate also taught me not to wash chicken because it spreads pathogens and bacteria everywhere. You also need to avoid cross-contamination by using separate dishware for raw meat and other foods and thoroughly washing anything that comes into contact with raw meat. Handling raw meat for the first time was scary, but I got through it with no food poisoning! If you take extra care to prepare your food safely, you should be good to go.</p>

            <h2>Cooking</h2>
            <p>Before I cooked the chicken, I cut it in half vertically to get a thinner cutlet that cooks through easier. I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic, getting that nice flavor. My roommate let me use his ninja grill, so I used a bit of coconut oil and slapped on the chicken. I let it sit until the bottom was golden brown, and flipped it over. I cooked it until I could easily cut through the chicken with a knife. If you have a food thermometer, use that to check the thickest part of the chicken. If it reads 165 or over, then you're good to go!</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Overall, I would say the chicken turned out pretty well! I was a bit worried about whether or not I overcooked or undercooked it, but luckily my roommate said it was thoroughly done. Because of that, the chicken was a bit tough, but the flavors went together well. I definitely learned how to cook this!</p>
