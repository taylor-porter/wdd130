                <h2>Ramen</h2>
            </div>
            <p>A nice bowl of ramen is a college classic, and can be a great comfort food if you're short on time or ingredients. I love this recipe from <a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/spicy-peanut-butter-ramen/" target="_blank">Budget Bytes for spicy peanut butter ramen noodles.</a> I know. Peanut butter in ramen!? Trust me, it’s worth a try. The peanut butter helps create a delicious creamy sauce and adds a bit of sustenance and protein to the meal. I would recommend using a bit under ¼ cup in the sauce to have a creamer sauce. I also substituted chili garlic sauce with hot sauce with garlic powder and chili flakes for a while until I found the real deal at the grocery store. Personally, I like to add an egg and some frozen peas to the ramen while it’s cooking and top it with some sliced ham, but like the recipe says, feel free to add what you want! </p>

                <h2>Chicken Curry With Rice</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Curry and rice has always been one of my go-to meals at home. Luckily, you can get curry sauce from the grocery store, making it super easy to make. If you have some canned chicken around, it’s even easier! Curry is one of my favorite ways to eat canned chicken and make it come to life. Simply put the chicken in a pan with a bit of oil, and add the curry sauce and let it simmer. Add some rice and vegetables, and you’ve got an effortless, delicious meal!</p>

                <h2>Barbeque Chicken Quesadilla</h2>
            </div>
            <p>I love myself a dang quesadilla! It’s definitely a life-saver when I’m in a crunch. Simply put a tortilla on a pan, add cheese, and boom! I always add a bit of extra cheese spilling out of the sides and on top of the quesadilla to get some nice, crispy cheese. It’s probably not good for cholesterol, but it’s good for my soul. I had some leftover grilled chicken one night, and I decided to chop it up and add it to my quesadilla with a spiral of barbeque sauce to give my quesadilla some extra protein and flavor.</p>
